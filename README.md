Investigating the other team

Investigating the other team members

During the cross examination we performed by interviewing the members of the other team we identified that the members were trying to mislead the interviewers. The answers given by the members were mismatching to each other. And during the discussion some of the members said that they were performing a custom clearance for one of their friend through the Sri Lanka Customs web site which they claimed legal. Finally we found out that it was just a story they made to escape from the questions we asked.
When we were investigating their PCs we found a word document which contained information regarding the Sri Lanka Customs web site which is restricted to the general public.  We found that they have performed a VPN scan through two PCs.
